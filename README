= act

act is a tool for automated configuration of remote hosts. It is not
particularly "smart" as it attempts to only depend on rsync(1), sh(1), and
ssh(1). (And utilities specified by POSIX-2017.)

Execution of act involves two main phases:

1. Copying a set of files to a temporary directory on the remote, specified in
   the file "files-<hostname>.list".
2. Copying a set of executable scripts, referred to as "modules", to the remote
   and executing them within the temporary directory. These modules and their
   arguments are specified in the file "modules-<hostname>.list".

Hosts may be specified on the command line. Otherwise, they are read from the
"hosts" file, one per line.
